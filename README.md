# URL shortening Service

Build a simple URL shortening Service. The service should be implemented as standalone application (preferable with .NET) and should provide the following features as

Restful API:
Shortening: Take a URL and return a much shorter URL.

 The input URL format must be valid

 Maximum character length for the hash portion of the URL is 6

 The Service should return a meaningful message with a suitable status code

Eg: https://www.sample-site.com/karriere/berufserfahrene/direkteinstieg/ =>
http://sample.site/GUKA8w/

Redirection: Take a short URL and redirect to the original URL.

Eg: http://sample.site/GUKA8w/ => https://www.samplesite.com/karriere/berufserfahrene/direkteinstieg/

Custom URL: Allow the users to pick custom shortened URL.

Eg: http://www.sample-site.com/karriere/jobsuche/ => http://sample.site/jobs

A frontend is not needed. As we just have a very small user base we do not need a
scalable service. The URLs should be persisted permanent, so there should be no
expiring feature. The data storage can be implemented as collection or embedded
database.

Recommended time frame: 4-5 hours
Speed is more important than perfectionism, but quality is more important than
quantity!
